Preliminary Version of Linear ADMM Model For DCOPF.

In this repository, you can find the DCOPF model in both centralized (GAMS file) and decentralized (MATLAB files). 

The corresponding paper has been presented in SEST2019 and you are invited to cite this paper as follows:

The Centralized DCOPF for PJM Network: You can run the PJM_DCOPF.gms


The Decentralized model for the same case study with the same results. You can run the DCOPF_LMP.m in the folder DROT1_V0.rar
The linear programming model for ADMM is the LP_ADMM.m in the same folder (DROT1_V0.rar)
